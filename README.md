## User stories and planning
### User Stories
- As a User (AAU), I should be able to sign up for an account and/or sign in with an account before I can view and book for flights.
- AAU, I want to be able to see all current flights and book for a flight, Which should clearly show me that I have successfully booked for this flight.
- AAU, I should be able to view a list of all the flights I have booked for and be able to click on a flight to view its related information.
- AAU, I need to be able to cancel my flight, which should remove it from my flights list and make me eligible to book for that same flight again if I want to.
- As an Admin (AAA), I need to be able to view a dashboard of all users which show their username and their current role.
- AAA, I should be able to create, view, edit and delete flights that I have created, as well as view flights created by other users.
- AAA, I need to be able to view a list of flights created by a specific admin user. This can be done by clicking on their name from either the users dashboard if they're an admin user or from the flights list.
